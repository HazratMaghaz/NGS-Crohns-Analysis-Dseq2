# NGS-Crohns-Analysis-Dseq2
A comprehensive analysis of differential gene expression in Crohnâ€™s Disease using RNA-seq data, DESeq2, and GSEA in R.
# Differential Gene Expression Analysis of Crohnâ€™s Disease using RNA-seq

This repository contains the full workflow and analysis of a bioinformatics project conducted as part of the *Next Generation Sequencing* course at **NUST â€“ School of Interdisciplinary Engineering and Sciences (SINES)**. The goal was to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in **Crohnâ€™s Disease (CD)** using RNA-seq count data from pediatric ileal biopsy samples and perform downstream analysis, including visualization and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).

## ðŸ§¬ Project Overview

- **Course Title:** Next Generation Sequencing  
- **Instructor:** Dr. Masood Ur Rehman Kayani  
- **Student:** Hazrat Maghaz
- 
## ðŸ”¬ Analysis Pipeline

### 1. **Dataset Overview**
- **Total samples:** 304  
  - 254 CD (Crohnâ€™s Disease) samples  
  - 50 control (non-IBD) samples  
- **Source:** Pediatric ileal biopsies  
- **Data format:** RNA-seq raw count matrix (genes Ã— samples)

### 2. **Correlation Heatmap**
- Created using Manhattan distance to visualize pairwise similarity.
- Darker blocks = more similar samples; lighter blocks = more different.

### 3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
- Showed clear separation between CD and control groups.
- PC1 and PC2 together explained 58% of data variance.

### 4. **DESeq2 Differential Expression Analysis**
- **Tool:** DESeq2 package in R.
- **Filtering threshold:** FDR < 0.05
- **Total genes analyzed:** 65,218  
  - Significant DEGs: 11,613  
    - Upregulated: 5,352 (46.08%)  
    - Downregulated: 6,261 (53.91%)

### 5. **Visualization of DEGs**
- **Volcano Plot:** Highlights logFC vs adjusted p-values.
- **Bubble Plot:** Top significant gene with p-value = 3.53e-71 and padj = 1.12e-66.

### 6. **Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA)**
- **Gene sets used:** HALLMARK from MSigDB
- **Result:**  
  - 19 pathways significantly positively enriched  
  - 3 positively enriched but not significant  
  - 1 pathway negatively enriched (e.g., oxidative phosphorylation)
